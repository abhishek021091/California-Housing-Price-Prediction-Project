# California-Housing-Price-Prediction-Project
This is my first unsupervised original project. 
* I got data from kaggle and used kaggle notebook to do EDA, feature engineering and the hyperparameter tuning. 
* Then I used modular coding as I have learnt from Krish Naik to build backend pipeline for my project.
* As I am a data scientist not a web app developer but this can't be limitation for me. So I used chatgpt to build a webapp using django which predicts price of housing in california.
